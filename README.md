# Web Scraping Card Market Project
This is a personal project where I made a Web Scraping runnable to transform a Card Market offers into useful data for a PowerBI Report.

## Report proyect
If you want to read more about this project, [here](Web%20Scrap%20CARDMARKET.pdf) is the `Web Scrap CARDMARKET.pdf` where I explain the process of this project and how to use it

## Wan to try it?
In the [final product repository](final%20product) is the executable and the architecture to run it and use the PowerBI procject to check the results (you need to install PowerBI Desktop before [PowerBI Desktop download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)).

It's necessary to download all folders.

## Are you interested in the code?
In the [source code repository](source%20code/packageWS) is the Python package with all the Python scripts. 


**Have fun!**
